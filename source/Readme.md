To start, run Generating_data.py to create the data for the Reyndols, Re=400. This is necessary as the resulting file is too large to be uploaded in github.
Once the data is saved, it is possible to run the other scripts in the folder, including the Jupyeter Notebooks in ./Post_Processing/ which generate the plots from the paper.
